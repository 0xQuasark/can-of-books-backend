# Can of Books Backend

In collaboration:
- Paul Brown
- Nika Skeba ([Frontend](https://github.com/nikaskeba/Can-of-Books-Frontend))

Whoops, I merged to main already. I'm not sure how to show the diff. I incorporated authorize.js, made endpoints use email to read/write

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.
